// What may be in the shipped .vsix — the single rule set consumed by BOTH
// scripts/copy-build.js (which composes ./build) and
// scripts/check-package-composition.js (the CI gate that answers "if we
// composed the package right now, would it be correct?"). One module, so the
// gate and the packager cannot answer differently about the same file. That
// divergence is issue #37 and it is the whole reason this file exists.
//
// ── ALLOWLIST, AND WHAT IT COSTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// copy-build.js used to compose by DENYLIST: five excluded names, `*.ts`, and
// everything else shipped. Default-include means every file type nobody thought
// about defaults INTO a Marketplace-published artifact, and the failure is
// silent and outbound — a `.env`, a `signing.key`, a coverage report, a source
// map that republishes the TypeScript the `.ts` filter existed to withhold
// (issue #41). You find out from the outside, after publishing, if ever.
//
// Inverting to an allowlist flips the failure direction: it becomes INBOUND —
// a task legitimately grows a new asset type (an ADO `Strings/*.resjson` bundle,
// an `.svg` icon, a `.wasm` blob) and the allowlist does not know about it. If
// the allowlist merely *filters*, that file silently vanishes from the package
// and we have swapped a silent-inclusion bug for a silent-omission bug — which
// is issue #42's shape, not a fix for it.
//
// So the allowlist is FAIL-CLOSED, not filter-quietly: a path matching no rule
// is an ERROR that names the file and says which list to add it to. That is the
// cost, stated plainly — the PR that adds a genuinely-new asset type will fail
// CI and its author must spend one line in SHIP_PATTERNS (or DROP_PATTERNS)
// saying what the file is for. Paid once per new asset type, at review time, on
// the PR that introduces it — instead of a file that is missing from a published
// package and a Marketplace listing that renders wrong.
//
// ── THE node_modules EXEMPTION, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN ────────────────────
//
// A packaged ADO task ships its pruned production `node_modules`. Third-party
// packages contain arbitrary file types: native `.node` binaries, `.wasm`,
// extensionless `LICENSE`/`AUTHORS`, `.flow`, bin shims. Applying the extension
// allowlist inside `node_modules` would drop files dependencies need at runtime
// and would fail this gate on every dependency bump for reasons no maintainer
// can act on — and a gate that fails constantly gets deleted. So `node_modules`
// is copied verbatim, EXEMPT from SHIP_PATTERNS, subject only to DROP_PATTERNS,
// NEVER_SHIP_PATTERNS and the symlink rule. That is a real hole in the
// allowlist; it is narrow, deliberate, and written down here rather than being
// an accident of the matcher.

const path = require('node:path')

// ── Root assets ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Copied to the package root. `required: true` means a missing file is a hard
// error, not a skip: copy-build.js used to guard every one of these with a bare
// `existsSync` and no `else`, so `npm run build:release` reported success while
// composing a package whose manifest pointed at files that were not in it
// (issues #42, #46).

//   4. unknown   — hard error naming the file. See the cost note above.
//
// DROP runs first so that a test fixture that happens to look like a secret
// (Tests/data/example.pem) is simply never composed, while the same name at a
// task root — where issue #41's fixture put `signing.key` — is composed-eligible
// and therefore a hard failure.
